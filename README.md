# Fish Weight Prediction


# Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to build an efficient machine learning model that helps to measure the weight of certain types of Fish.

# About the Project
This is a model that predicts the weight of a fish given various features like Vertical Length, Diagonal Length, Cross Length, Height and Species. 

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.

## Future Scope
1. Improve the front-end.
2. Try to collect more data and make the model a bit more robust.
